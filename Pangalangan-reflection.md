######GPS 1.1 Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
>The order of workflow and which commands to use at which times

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
>Pushing feature branches to GitHub before merging, instead of merging in Git and then pushing to GitHub. When it's okay and when it's not

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
>Clarification on commands, is it ever okay to do [x]? Do you remember how to do [thing]?

**What still confuses you about Git?**
>Branch maintenance. Accidentally creating a branch off of a branch. Will that mess anything up?

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
>Not as scary as I'd thought. Less emphasis on "Guided", but still helpful. Faster than Google! I'm not used to Google Hangouts and my laptop webcam is at the bottom left of my screen, so it's awkward. I feel pressure when sharing my screen and someone has to watch me type, but I am feeling better about embracing failure and getting back up again. My guide and pair were both patient, so that helped. Our guide offered different examples we may encounter in life outside bootcamp. He also pulled us back from spending too much time on one line.
