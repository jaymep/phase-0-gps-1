* I was struggling with branching and pulling/fetching and merging
* The whole git workflow really sunk in because we did it a few times. Still a little unsure about the fetching/merging and heads
* I asked the guide about why I was having problems creating branches in the week 1 assignments. I asked my partner if she was ready to move on and more procedural questions like that
* I'm still a little confused about pulling and merging and fetching
* It was a good experience. It went a little longer than I would have liked but I do feel like it was beneficial to me
